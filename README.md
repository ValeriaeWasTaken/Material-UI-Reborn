Dawntrail support of https://github.com/Sevii77/ffxiv_materialui_accent

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the original using a custom plugin for installation, and this being a penumbra texture pack with the primary goal of being functional in DT. 
> It is no longer possible to customize colors on certain elements.  
> Similar functionality might be implemented using penumbra in the future. Maybe even getting the plugin updated. Options are being explored.
