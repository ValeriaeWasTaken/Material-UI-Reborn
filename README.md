### v9 | Job Icon Overhaul and Refactoring
- Job Icons
    - Colors can now be fully customized
    - Macro gearset icons cleaned up and improved
    - Alternate Color options have been removed as they are no longer necessary
- Refactoring Part 1
    - Files are being cleaned up and optimized, no changes should be noticable aside from one;
    - There is no longer 2 variations of the "Original" look for party list shields. High Contrast is now the default.
    - Issues/Glitches may occur due to this. Report any so they can be fixed asap.
