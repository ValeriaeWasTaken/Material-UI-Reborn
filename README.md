> The conversion from standalone penumbra modpack to aetherment might potentially break a couple things.

### Future Plans
- [ ] Gearset icons need improvements.
- [ ] Add minimal bars to other UI elements.
- [ ] Finish the Main Command Icons that skotlex had begun working on.
- [ ] Take a look at VPR Job Bar for any possible edits.
- [ ] Also take a look at PCT Canvas for any potential edits.
### Known Issues
- [ ] The "No color bar" setting for gear set icons dont actually remove the colorbar.
- [ ] Custom delivery heart UI isnt using accent color.
- [ ] Limitbreak bar doesnt respect parameter bar settings, it always uses the silver style.
- [ ] High contrast shield setting is alot more subtle than intended.
