### Known Issues/Plans
- [ ] Gearset icons need improvements.
- [ ] Add more minimal bars.
- [ ] Limitbreak bar is designed in the silver style of bar, add a black square version of it
- [ ] High contrast shield setting is alot more subtle than intended, make it stronger.
- [ ] Take a look at VPR Job Bar for any possible edits.
- [ ] Also take a look at PCT Canvas for any potential edits.
