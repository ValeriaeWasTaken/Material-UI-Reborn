### Future Plans
- [ ] Create a Square/Black style for Limit Break bar as it only has Silver and Minimal.
- [ ] Gearset icons need improvements.
- [ ] Add glow version of gearset icons
- [ ] Add minimal bars to remaining UI elements.
- [ ] Finish the Main Command Icons that skotlex had begun working on.
- [ ] Take a look at AST/PCT/VPR Job UIs for any possible edits.

### Known Issues
- [ ] Something probably.
